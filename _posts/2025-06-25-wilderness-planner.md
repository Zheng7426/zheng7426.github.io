The recent two weeks have been a mess. I have not been sleeping or eating properly. Thus, it is time to build a personal planner that could track and record what I would like to do each day, therefore adding more routine to my life. 

I'm going to call it Wilderness Planner because my recent state of mind is like wandering in the wilderness.

In terms of technical implementation, the project should have at least three components: Front-End, Back-End, and Database.
